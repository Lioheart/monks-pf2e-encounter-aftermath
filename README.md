# Monk's PF2E Encounter Aftermath
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT
Ever ask your players after a combat what 'What are you doing now' and then have to awkwardly figure out what's happening every 10 minutes, while everyone is talking over each other.  Yeah, that's no fun.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
On the Party sheet a new tab will be added called "Activities".

You can drag and drop Macros, Actions, Items and Feats to the party members and then set how long that action will take to do.

The GM can then click the Advance Time button to advance game time until those actiosn are ready to be completed.  And either the player or GM will then have access to a button to run those actions.

If your character is choosing to do nothing for a periods of time, right click the party member and select "Do Nothing" to have that action added.

Statistics are also kept for the total time it's taken to complete all actions, how many actions remain, and how much time remains to be taken.
